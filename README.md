## MGT6203 Team 26 Final Deliverable

#### Getting Started
To view the full analysis please use the team26final_analysis.pdf file. This pdf contains the entire analysis and the R code used with some explanations and comments. If you use the Rmd file and try to run, just know that some filepaths may have changed and some libraries may need to be installed first. The Python script essentially just joins and drops some data to produce the data set used in the R code (shown in Rmd file and analysis pdf). The video presentation can be found here: https://youtu.be/Amd71x0y7vs
